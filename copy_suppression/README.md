# Copy Suppression

This is a reproduction of significant results [sections 2.1-3.3 currently] from [Copy Suppression: Comprehensively Understanding an Attention Head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04625). Notetably, this includes the main CSP ablation results described in the paper.

The main functionality is in the [`ablations.py`](ablations.py) and [`circuits.py`](circuits.py) files, with overarching exposition in [`paper.ipynb`](paper.ipynb).
